The corrected CSS code specifically targets only paragraph (`p`) elements within the `.container` element:

```css
.container p:nth-child(even) { background-color: #f0f0f0; }
```

This ensures that only even-numbered paragraph elements within the `.container` will have the specified background color.  This makes the styling predictable and consistent, avoiding the potential issues of the original incorrect code.
